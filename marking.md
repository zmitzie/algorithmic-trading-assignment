## General marking scheme

Given the questions we've seen on Piazza since the project was released, I think it's worth providing a few clarifications -- and hopefully, reassurance -- about what we will be expecting from students at the time of marking.

Both tasks will be marked similarly to how you've marked the peer-assessed tasks in Weeks 3 and 6, using a rubric with several criteria. For each criteria, the markers will grant a certain amount of marks depending on how well you fulfilled the requirements. The different criteria will hold different weights -- for example, for Task 2, whether your code works and is free of bugs will be worth more marks than whether it's well-commented.

### Task 1

For Task 1, the markers will assess:

- the *completeness*/coverage of your review: have you identified all the important issues with the code?
- your own *implementation*: have you implemented sensible solutions to these issues in your version?
- the quality of your *feedback*: have you explained the issues and your solutions/changes in a way that will help the author improve their coding practice and/or skills?


### Task 2

For Task 2, the criteria are as follows (in order of importance -- items with higher weight come first):

- Is the code working as expected, free of bugs, as specified in the task? Does it produce sensible output?
- Were the different strategies tested and compared appropriately and fairly using test data? Is the analysis of the final results sensible, insightful, and well-presented? Does the presented analysis show a good depth of investigation, and a significant attempt to critically assess the different strategies as they are implemented?
- Is the code generally well-structured (control flow, object types...)? Whenever significant design and/or implementation decisions were made, were they sensible and clearly explained (e.g. with code comments or in the docstring)?
- Is the code generally well-commented and documented, with appropriate docstrings?
- Is the code clear, concise, and easy to read, with consistent style?
